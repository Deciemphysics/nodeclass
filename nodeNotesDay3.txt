Events - emit (sending out events), listener (receiving events).

Emitters send out event, ie. heres data, Im finished, etc

Listeners are waiting for the event

Streams - flow of data ( stream of data )

Specifically, streams are ABSTRACT INTERFACES implemented by various objects in Node.js

Interfaces are contracts, they must satisfy the contract by guaranteeing certain methods. 

Objects that let you read data from a source and write data to a destination in a continuous fashion are streams.

There are 4 types of streams

    Readable - streams used for read operations
    Writable - Streams used for write operations
    Duplex - Streams which can be used for both read and write operations
    Transform - A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

Streams - Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter and throws several events at different instance of times. 

    data - This even is fired when there is data available to read
    end - This event is fired when there is no more data available to read
    error - This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data
    finish - This event is fired when all data has been flushed to underlying systems
